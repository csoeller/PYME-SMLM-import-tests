# A set of SMLM sample data sets to test PYME import capabilities

While we are improving PYME import capabilities for SMLM formats it turned out to be useful to have a set of sample data sets that we can use to run tests.

The data collected here is a mixture of our own data (currently mostly exported from a Zeiss Elyra Microscope) and SMLM data sets we found across the web.

We attempt to acknowledge sources properly and comply with licenses appropriately. If you are an author/owner of a data set that is part of our collection and would like to get in touch to discuss anything related to this please send us an email.

As a brief note, we could have written clever Python code to pull these examples from across the web and thus avoided explicitly including these data sets but I (CS) decided this was a little too much work and we tried this simpler route instead.

## Data sources

### vLUME data sets

One set of data is from the following paper:

 Spark, A., Kitching, A., Esteban-Ferrer, D., Handa, A., Carr, A. R., Needham, L.-M., Ponjavic, A., Santos, A. M., McColl, J., Leterrier, C., Davis, S. J., Henriques, R. & Lee, S. F. vLUME: 3D virtual reality for single-molecule localization microscopy. Nat Methods 17, 1097â€“1099 (2020).

The original data sets are available from [https://github.com/lumevr/vLume](https://github.com/lumevr/vLume).

### ThunderSTORM 3D data set

This data set is lifted from the website of Christoph Leterrier where he explains the [ThunderSTORM column format](http://www.neurocytolab.org/tscolumns/).
